- JWT sent by cookie: frontend does not need to worry about sending JWT, 
  it's done automatically
- cookie with Http-only cannot be accessed by frontend
- cookie has limitation: 4096 Octets
- browser does all the necessary to send JWT by cookies if on the same domain
- if the domain are different, to be able to share JWT via cookies, 
  define a "proxi" in frontend package.json

- what if I deploys my app (in producution); how could I use the  "proxy" tips 
  in frontend package.json ?: I have to redirect to the host address, see _redirects 
  in /public for an example
